Back in 2012, [Sergio Zambrano](https://stackoverflow.com/users/595488/sergio) wrote a post on how a simple custom font can be used to create a semantic yet seo friendly graph bar. Since the original article was lost, this is a recreation of that same post, showing how a custom font can be applied to display an SEO friendly graph bar.

Try it yourself
---------------

1.  Download the **decbar** and **graphbar** fonts by Sergio Zambrano.
2.  Upload the individual folders to the **fonts** directory on your website.
3.  Add the code in **style.css** to your stylesheet. Make sure to replace _yoursite.com_ with the URL of your website. This basically adds a reference to the custom fonts we uploaded and some basic CSS styling.
4.  Use the graph bar in your HTML code through the **graphbar** class, which in turn uses the **decbar** and **graphbar** fonts uploaded earlier. See **Example.html** for reference.
